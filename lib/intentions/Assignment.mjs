/** **************************************************
 * The Assignment Class provides the core infrastructure for grading assignments.
 *
 * The Intention of the assignment is to be fully graded. However, if
 * the actual grading process is different for every assignment. Therefore,
 * this base class implements an abstract assignment process that more specialised
 * assessment classes can leverage. This intention takes care of
 *
 * 1. Identifying the assignment to assess
 * 2. Fetch all submissions.
 * 3. Upload the scores (and potential feedbacks) back to Moodle.
 *
 * This intention requires a `course` context that contains a valid
 * course id.
 *
 * Specialised assessment classes should either implement `assessSubmission`
 * or `handleSubmissions`.
 *
 * `assessSubmission` is used for assessing a single submission. It can access
 * the submission object through the `this.activeSubmission`-property. Often
 * the active submission object with its complex structure is of little use
 * for the assessment. Therefore it is recommended to use the accessor functions
 * such as `getText()`, `getRawText()`, `getFiles()`, or `getSubmittedContent()`.
 * The latter will provide the unfiltered list of submission elements under the
 * submission's `plugins` property.
 *
 * `handleSubmissions` is used for batch processing all submissions that
 * need handling. This function receives a list of submissions for assessment.
 * The function should be aware that the submission list could be empty. Overriding
 * `handleSubmissions` is useful when working with external assessment scripts.
 * The handler receives a filtered list of submissions according the to the
 * parameters of the intention (see "Special options"). Therefore, it is not
 * necessary to filter the submission list unless there are more
 * specialised constraints, of course.
 *
 * Note: if `handleSubmissions` is overridden, then
 * the assessSubmission function is only needed of the new handler is calling it.
 *
 * Special options:
 *
 * - `assess_all`: runs the assessment for all available submissions. Defaults to `false`.
 * - `skip_feedback`: do not upload the feedback (good for testing). Defaults to `false`.
 * - `moodle_state`: set a specific step in Moodle's grading workflow. Defaults to `released`.
